Implementation for Stochastic Variational Inference for following models :

1. Gaussian Process Regression Netwroks (Wilson, 2011) and Sparse GPRN 
2. Sparse Gaussian Process Regression Netwroks

The main model is implemented in TensorFlow. However the supporting functions under onoffgp module have been insipred/partially taken from GPflow(https://github.com/GPflow/)
